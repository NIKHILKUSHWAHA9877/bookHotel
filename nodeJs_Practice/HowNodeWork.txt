So when user sends request to our node server then 
First it gets stores in one Event queue....

Then there is one Even loop there which always keeps eyes on Event Queue and its request..
(This use FIFO Approch)
then Event loop takes that taska and send them to Blocking Operations or Non Blocking Operations also called Syncronous and Asyncronous

If task is small then it will assigned to Syncronous

then after assiggning task like if it is assigned to Blocking Operstions then Blocking operation will go TO Thread POOL

So Thread Pool is pool where there are many threads as a workers which will help in our work.

So Blocking Operation/Syncronous will ask Thread Pool to give him a thread for work the tread pool will check if there is any thread avliable because threads are limited if avliable then it will assign to Blocking Operatiion for work...

And when that Task will compleate then Thread Pool will come back to Thread Pool and RETURN THE RESULT. and we will send Response to user...


Blocking Operations/Syncronous use 4 threads by default , Now let's suppose all 4 threads are in use they are already doing task , Now when will task will come then it has to wait until one thread will get free....

So in real world example if more users will come in our app/website and we had written our code in blocking operations then it will slow down or crash our site , So it is always good Practice to write code in non blocking operations/Asyncronous
