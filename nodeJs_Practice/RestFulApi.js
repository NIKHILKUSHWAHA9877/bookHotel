// So restful api works on SERVER and CLIENT ARTICTECTURE
// like server is a different machine and client is a different machine they both should not be dependent on each other
//so previously when there where no api's then how things work before API , before api there where only client and server Client send requests and servers directly send response to them 
//******* but now when api came now we client do not directly send request to server first we send request to Api by using some methods like GET ,POST ,PUT ,DELETE (also called http request ot http verbs)etc
//********WE CAN CONVERT NORMAL API'S TO RESTFUL API'S */
//where we use these http methods/http verbs
// so let us suppose we are creating a school website so to create , read , updatr and delete sudents data we will use different http methods like -:

//CREATE = (USE (POST)
// READ = (USE (GET)
// UPDATE = (USE (PUT , PATCH)
// DELETE = (USE (DELETE);
