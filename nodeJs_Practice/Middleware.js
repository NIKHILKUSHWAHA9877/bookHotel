// What is middleware ?
// so middleware is something that work between the client request and response . like any request come from client and then after processing we had to send him/her the result . this whole process of processing and sending result is whole idea of server where we create server for this .
// so processing and reading those request there are many 3rd party middleware avliable so these are basically function that have access to request and send those data after after modifying and so that we can send them s result.
// to impove capabilities of our code to enhance it we use middlewares , 
// middleware can do any of thse following things like -:
// running any code , creating cookies read cookies , cookies parces , converting json data to object , convert string to json ,
// by using middleware we can also do if like something gone wrong then we can send responce or terminate request or responce and send any error at place of them ;
// we can aslo pass one middleware function to invoke another middleware function like channing , like after finishing this start this then that then send responce
